# Team Optimal Electrical Documentation

## Notes:

Note that in the PCB layout diagrams, two views are shown, one indicating the
top side of the PCB, and one indicating the bottom side of the PCB (as viewed
from the top)

The colors are as follows:

| Color  | Purpose           |
| -------|-------------------|
| RED    | Top copper        |
| GREEN  | Bottom copper     |
| BLUE   | Top silkscreen    |
| PURPLE | Bottom silkscreen |

For more useful documentation of the PCBs, refer to the KiCad files at
[https://github.com/idp-l211/electrical](https://github.com/idp-l211/electrical).
PDFs are simply not sufficient for useful PCB documentation.
